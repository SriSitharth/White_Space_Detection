# White Space Detection and Tagging POC for Construction Drawings

Welcome to the repository for my White Space Detection and Tagging Proof of Concept (POC) project! This project is a POC aimed at detecting white spaces in images using OpenCV and exploring the feasibility of adding tags to soft drawings commonly used in construction.

## Features

    White Space Detection: Utilize OpenCV to detect white spaces in images, exploring the initial steps of identifying areas without content.
    Tagging Soft Drawings: Experiment with the idea of adding tags or labels to soft drawings used in construction projects, evaluating the potential benefits of enhancing clarity and organization.
    Image Processing: Explore basic image processing techniques to enhance the quality and accuracy of white space detection, though not fully optimized or comprehensive.
    Customizable Tagging: Investigate the possibility of customizing tags according to specific requirements or conventions used in construction documentation, though not fully implemented.

## Getting Started

As this project is a Proof of Concept (POC) and not fully completed, getting started involves exploring the codebase and experimenting with the existing functionalities. Follow these steps to begin:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Review the code in your preferred code editor to understand the approach taken for white space detection and tagging.
    Experiment with the provided scripts and modify them to test different scenarios or enhancements.
    Keep in mind that this POC is not fully functional or optimized, so expect limitations and areas for improvement.

## Usage

    Exploration: Use this POC as a starting point to explore the potential of white space detection and tagging for construction drawings.
    Experimentation: Experiment with different image processing techniques and tagging strategies to evaluate their effectiveness.
    Feedback and Evaluation: Provide feedback on the feasibility and potential value of further developing this concept into a fully functional solution.

## Support

As this project is a POC and not fully completed, support may be limited. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it, but keep in mind that it is not intended for production use.
