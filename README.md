# White Space Detection and Tagging for Construction Drawings

Welcome to the repository for my White Space Detection and Tagging project! This project is designed to detect white spaces in images using OpenCV and add tags to soft drawings commonly used in construction.

## Features

    White Space Detection: Utilize OpenCV to detect white spaces in images, helping to identify areas without content.
    Tagging Soft Drawings: Add tags or labels to soft drawings used in construction projects, enhancing clarity and organization.
    Image Processing: Apply image processing techniques to enhance the quality and accuracy of white space detection.
    Customizable Tagging: Customize tags according to specific requirements or conventions used in construction documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the White Space Detection and Tagging project:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install OpenCV and any additional dependencies required for image processing. Follow the official OpenCV documentation for installation instructions.
    Open the project in your preferred code editor.
    Modify the code to specify the image files you want to process and customize the tagging process as needed.
    Run the code to detect white spaces in images and add tags to soft drawings.

## Usage

    White Space Detection: Use the provided scripts to detect white spaces in images, helping to identify areas without content.
    Tagging Soft Drawings: Automatically add tags or labels to soft drawings used in construction projects, improving organization and clarity.
    Customization: Customize the tagging process according to specific requirements or conventions used in construction documentation.
